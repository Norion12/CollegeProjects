# CollegeProjects
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In Project 3, I created a program for a Grocery company to see how often items were purchased in a day.

What did you do particularly well?
I was able to get the code working well fairly quickly. I was able to remove several blocks of code that were unnessesary.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have moved some code into functions, as some things were called 2 times, although it would not save very much complexity

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Most challanging was the integration of Python, and getting the C++ code to find the Python code and run it correctly.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Teamwork, troubleshooting problems inherant to a system, and using multiple languages to solve a problem

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Incapsulated functions along with comments and correct file formating helped with this.
