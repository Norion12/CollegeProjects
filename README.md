# CollegeProjects
# CS-210 Programming Languages
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In Project 3, I created a program for a Grocery company to see how often items were purchased in a day.

What did you do particularly well?
I was able to get the code working well fairly quickly. I was able to remove several blocks of code that were unnessesary.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have moved some code into functions, as some things were called 2 times, although it would not save very much complexity

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Most challanging was the integration of Python, and getting the C++ code to find the Python code and run it correctly.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Teamwork, troubleshooting problems inherant to a system, and using multiple languages to solve a problem

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Incapsulated functions along with comments and correct file formating helped with this.

# CS-230 Operating Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The Gaming Room was a client looking for creating a game, Draw It or Lose It, which was similar to Pictionary, and was working on one platform. They wished to outsource the project so it could be used on multiple platforms. I was able to write code to run the game on a server, using a RESTful API, and incorperating code to work on a server-side basis. I felt my code written using the singleton method came out well.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document made it very clear what I needed to to, along with UML documents, made writing and implementing the code much easier than trying to think of structures while writing the code. This kept me from making mistakes, and allowed me to focus on the code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to revise and go back over the server-side implementations of server code, this, while working, was the toughest part of the project, and I still have much to learn on server calls through html, and how the nitty gritty of this type of coding works.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I needed to approach the client on what type of server we would be using for the project, and also confirm how this would be implemeneted. Knowing what back end changes would need to be covered by the client, helps me to know what code I am writing, and how to implement the solution to the problem. In this case it was building a platform using a server-run design.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the design document and software using the tools I learned through the course. I think if I was to work in this field again, I would talk more to the client, and use what I had learned at that point to make more meaningful desisions. I am still learning the skills needed before I can write a design document to a level of quality I would like. The more I learn in my studies, the more my design document will reflect that, and be more useful with less revisions.
