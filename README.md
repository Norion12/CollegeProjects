# CollegeProjects
# CS-210 Programming Languages
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In Project 3, I created a program for a Grocery company to see how often items were purchased in a day.

What did you do particularly well?
I was able to get the code working well fairly quickly. I was able to remove several blocks of code that were unnessesary.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have moved some code into functions, as some things were called 2 times, although it would not save very much complexity

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Most challanging was the integration of Python, and getting the C++ code to find the Python code and run it correctly.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Teamwork, troubleshooting problems inherant to a system, and using multiple languages to solve a problem

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Incapsulated functions along with comments and correct file formating helped with this.

# CS-230 Operating Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The Gaming Room was a client looking for creating a game, Draw It or Lose It, which was similar to Pictionary, and was working on one platform. They wished to outsource the project so it could be used on multiple platforms. I was able to write code to run the game on a server, using a RESTful API, and incorperating code to work on a server-side basis. I felt my code written using the singleton method came out well.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design document made it very clear what I needed to to, along with UML documents, made writing and implementing the code much easier than trying to think of structures while writing the code. This kept me from making mistakes, and allowed me to focus on the code.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to revise and go back over the server-side implementations of server code, this, while working, was the toughest part of the project, and I still have much to learn on server calls through html, and how the nitty gritty of this type of coding works.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I needed to approach the client on what type of server we would be using for the project, and also confirm how this would be implemeneted. Knowing what back end changes would need to be covered by the client, helps me to know what code I am writing, and how to implement the solution to the problem. In this case it was building a platform using a server-run design.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached the design document and software using the tools I learned through the course. I think if I was to work in this field again, I would talk more to the client, and use what I had learned at that point to make more meaningful desisions. I am still learning the skills needed before I can write a design document to a level of quality I would like. The more I learn in my studies, the more my design document will reflect that, and be more useful with less revisions.

# CS-255 System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project consists of a company that wished to create a driving school, with an application to manage students user accounts, study material and the ability for customers to set up driving appointments. This program also was to be used for the employees of the company to manage driving times and customers. This project was meant to teach how to approach design documents and handling requirements set forth by the customer of our software development company.

What did you do particularly well?

I feel like I communicated by ideas well within my UML diagrams. I learned a lot about the creation of design documents and UML diagrams of different types. I think my best work was with the readability of my diagrams, and knowing how much information to in include on each.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would like to learn better ways of communicating my ideas through presentations. In the last project we worked with powerpoint slides to convey our idea of the project to the customer. I felt like I did a good job, but I think I need to learn more about how interactions with these types of customers work, and what they expect in such a meeting.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Throughout this class, I read over the interview transcript with the customer dozens of times. This was very useful for me when designing the system. I liked having that meeting in a form that I could go back to and reference to make sure and get everything exactly how the customer wanted the system to work. I think in the end, you really need to meet as many of the customer's goals as possible, and notifiy them if for any reason you can't meet them. Getting this back and forth feedback midway through a project is going to produce the best quality product.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I think reviewing the custmoers goals was the first and biggest step. From there on, brainstorming and iterating through my ideas, while getting them on paper helped build out the program I wanted to make. Each time I designed a diagram and design document, I had a better idea of what the end product would be. In the end, while these desgin documents help as a reference material, just the process of creating them helps me understand the flow of the program better.

# CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

In this course, I reviewed a end user focus group. Within this focus group the members talked about what they would like to see in the end product. Not only did they answer questions about the product, but they expanded upon ideas of others in what would make a good product. From these wants, I was able to create "user stories". These were able to sum up what the customer wanted, what it required of the program, and what purpose it was to serve. Through common language, it is easier to see the requirements written in a way that really describes what that part of the program is meaning to accomplish, and not just what needs to be added to the program. This, I think really helps the programmer understand why they are adding a feature and to what purpose. Not only does this increase clarity, but it helps identify problems in logic early.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing programs there are many methods to structure work done, and how it is allocated to different employees. The "Waterfall" approach was once king, but now more and more companies are moving to an "Agile" mindset. Instead of having rigid requirements that are followed in order, with a final product given to the customer in the end, agile works in an iterative process, refining the product over time, and giving the customer updates regularly. I fell that in most cases I would use the agile approach when I can, as it seems to really cut down on fully developed parts of a program that are unneeded, time taken to spot mistakes, and gives the customer a chance to make changes and adress faults in the program early, saving time and money.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I think that a good team member will be open with their fellow programmers. Not only to let coworkers know your progress, so they can better understand how a project is progressing, but also to ask for help when needed. I think a very hard thing for some people is asking for help. Most people would rather figure out a problem themselves, but in a company setting, asking for help early can save time and money on a project. Keeping this open communication with your team members is both good for you, and for the health of the team and the project.

# CS-300 Data Structures and Algorithms

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In this course we covered different data structures and how to evaluate them for runtime efficiency. Using Big O notations we covered many different storage methods, sorts, and structures and tried to find out which ones were the best suited for certain programs.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I did a lot of research on my own, watching videos on how the different data structures worked, videos were very helpful in understanding how the sorts were moving through the data. Data structures are important to understand at a base level because they can affect how well a program runs. Picking a sort algorithm that is efficient verses one that is not can make the difference between a bad program and a good one.  While both can work, one will run better than the other, and at certain data loads, may not work on a system depending on how inefficient the algorithm is.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

When I got stuck, which happened many times in this course, I looked up as many videos and tutorials online as I could. Also, when I got stuck coding, taking a break from the code and coming back later always worked well in keeping me moving forward.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

I think this course more than any other so far has helped me understand writing code at a deep level. This class was very challenging, but I feel like I can write in C++ much better now. In the future I cannot comfortably say which data structures would suit a project, and I now can also check runtime for inefficiencies.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I learned how to write better pseudocode and developed my style of commenting within the code. I feel like my work is not only more and more functional, but also can be read better by anyone else working on code with me.

# CS-305 Data Software Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial was a company that wanted to create a fincial guidance website that managed various types of investments. This was to be provided by a web application with high security.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I think that I was able to determine baseline vulnerabilities well with the Maven dependancy check. This tool helped me find most of the issues with this program's core building blocks. I feel like this along with good coding practices and contant testing helps maintain secure code. Keeping th code clean, with great formatting and commenting also in the end helps security becuase the code is more readable and updateable. In this company's line of work, software secuirty is paramount, as the data in this program is very sensitive. 

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

It took a bit to learn what to look for in secuirty flaws, and I feel like the more I practice the more I will learn what major points to look for. Keeping an eye out in general for security flaws will now be a part of my coding ethic.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

Looking up information on the type of program helped me understand what steps needed to be taken, and in a worse-case senerio shows the points of failure in a program. Mitigan techniques follow this line of thinking, and completeness is key.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To check for new vulnerabilites, I ran a maven dependancy check before and after the code was added. This allowed me to get a general look over of the code and make sure no new issues were added.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I like the maven dependency check, also keeping my commenting and formatting in a good place would help security as a whole. This and research, as knowing the failure points of a system is important before you start coding a project.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I would show the ability to answer and complete questions, while recognizing flaws in the testing methodology. In this instance, while the project was finished as asked for, there are a lot of problems with this code base that would absolutely need to be fixed for a real world example. Even though this is not a part of the project, I included notes at the end to make sure it is known that there are still security problems with this code base. This is mainly becuase the code base is very old, and since it was written, many vulnerabilites have cropped up in the codebase's framework. Most of these can be fixed with version updates, but serious flaws remain. I want to make sure that I state these things when I see them, and not gloss over just becuase it isn't part of the work I was given.

# CS-320 Software Testing and Automation

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Secure and function software I feel is measured by testing, and testing often.  Unit testing as code is bieng written and keepig good coding practices through a project will help find bugs early, and really remove extra work later, also known as technical debt. Using this testing methodology in all work I feel will really shine through and create better and faster work. Along with completeness and full suite of tests, good commenting and formating can make viewing, changing and reading code easier and save time.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Looking at not only what is needed to fulfill a requirement list, but also what that entails in security and testing to get there is key. Knowing that your program fulfills all requirements in a functional way is also important. DevOps and DevSecOps pipelines are more and more common and the more you learn about testing techniquites, the better you can apply them to your daily work.

How do I approach designing software?

When working with a new project, I start by reading the requirements over serveral times. I then do some research on the type of program, and what problems may come up. After getting a good handle on the project, I will create an architecture, then start coding in small section. After each section has enough meat to test the code, I will develop unit tests, test the code, then move to the next segement. After doing this throughout the build, I combine the code and do inigration testing. I learned a lot from this class, and I think thse testing methodologies will stick with me my entire carrer.

# CS-330 Comp Graphic and Visualization

How do I approach designing software?

In this class, I gained knowledge in shader creation and was able to practice my design skills by planning a 3d scene and implementing methods to create the best possible representation of my scene within OpenGL. With this project, we worked with a small bit of sample code and built out a 3d scene by hard coding 3d objects into the scene and rendering the scene within a world. With camera, lighting and movement coding we are able to look around the scene and view the models. In this project I had to plan each object and how it would be implimented, and for that creating functions that could be reused within the project to create multiple objects.

How do I approach developing programs?

Within this project I iterated through reviesions of my project to create the final scene by adding elements, lighting, texture and movement. I started with a basic 3d world, added simple objects, then textured these objects. Working with lighting and normals to create realistic lighting and reflections, and finally to bring all of these together into one program. Throughout the course, I went back and improved previous code to make it more modular and well organized. The more I learned, the more I applied to code I had already completed. In the end, my code was much different, but worked better and I had a better understanding of the OpenGL framework.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

In this course, I learned about game engine and shader design, and I feel like most of my experience gained is working with existing code and working though the though process of the original code writer. While useful, many other programs provide 3d element and mesh generation tools that make hard coding in verticies and functions obsolete. I do appreciate my new found knowledge on the inner workings of the OpenGL framework and how, on a granular level, OpenGL works. I feel that this knowledge will help me in the future, whether or not I work in graphics in the future.

# CS-340 Client/Server Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I think the keys to writing maintainable, readable and adaptable code are keeping the code clean and modular. Working on pieces and confirming the operation of the program helps you move forward with confidence that you are goin in the right direction. Not only does this make your code easier to read later on, it gives you confidence that you are making progress towards a final working product. Working at first in the shell let me confirm the working status of my CRUD module, and in turn the final project. I could expand upon the currect project and add or remove animals for the database, update entries, and provide more functionality to the program. This wouldn't be very hard, as the code I wrote would allow for more operations than the final project ultimately used.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Within this projeect, I used many different APIs. Starting with MongoDB, learning the way the database worked and applying that functionality with Pythod and eventually the Dash framwork was a hard task. Not only did I need to understand each of these components, I also needed to make them work together. I found the best way to come at this project was to work in small pieces. Getting the code to work in smaller chunks helped me move slowly but surely foward. I think this approach to programming is the best for me and provides small stepping stones mvoing forward, where my mistakes can be addressed along the way. I also found that doing more research on how the system worked before starting was nessesary. Learning MongoDB from a research perspective before starting to code helped me not waste time in my overall project.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

I think that computer scientists look to create a product that meets the requirements that the client asked for, and expand upon these when it makes since. Bieng able to understand what your customer wants is important, and not just to add what they ask for. In this case, I feel that checking back with the customer regularly would help expand the quality of the program and help the client better use the end product. In the end, this project provided a good way for the customer to navigate the large amount of data they were given, so that they can spend more time training dogs, and less time sifting through a massive database. This type of control over data really does help in the end, and makes a massive list of data a usefull and consise tool to do real work.

# CS-465 Full Stack Development 1

Architecture - Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).

Through this course, I learned about the different approaches to developing and deploying a web page. In this course, we created a client facing webpage with Express HTML, using the normal backend server and front end client. I also worked with Angular to create a Single Page Application which ran the majority of the heavy lifting from the client computer. Through the whole process, I used Javascript to create a working set of pages, both with its own advantages and disadvantages. SPAs are easier on the server and snappy, but are harder for search engines to read currently.

Architecture - Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

The backend used MongoDB, a NoSQL database. This is much easier to work with in my opinion than SQL, with much more lax restrictions on data storage. This allows for more robust saving of data and with Mongoose, used in this class, is easy to work with and manage without SQL Scemas.

Functionality - How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?

JSON is the easy to understand format used to store data in our MongoDB database, all values are stored in value pairs. This allows easy read from javascript and storage within MongoDB.

Functionality - Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

The main piece of functionality I enjoyed in the project was the encapsulation of resources. With a good structure, making changes to the code were much easier. Each part of the full stack process can work well together with a good file structure and setup. When you neeed to adjust a certian page, just going to that page's html and ts files makes updating easy. Once the CRUD methods were setup in the backend, working with the code in the front end becomes easier, just reusing these calls, and working with modularity in mind.

Testing - Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

I found the use of Postman to help with understanding how the website is structured and how calls to the API are made. Understanding the endpoints and creating a unit diagram helped me understand how the site was laid out and what calls should go where. Once the login security was implemented, adding these methods to check along with each method call was easy, letting me use this in many different places at once.

Reflection - How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

This class was well laid out, with great videos and explinations. Along with furthering my understanding of Javascript, understanding middleware and the full stack development process will definately help me in the future. I found this coding to be fun, and I may choose to work in this field in the future. I like the flexibilty of Javascript and using the middleware to do mundane tasks. Using these different middleware tools and APIs along the way has really shown me the depth of the field and how many different tools there are, along with the confidence that I can learn new tools quickly and use them in my work.

# CS-360 Mobile Architect & Programming

Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

In this course, we were to choose an app to develop. My app was an inventory app designed to track inventory in a store or warehouse. This app was to allow for different users, and have a register and login screen followed by an inventory of items. The user needs to be able to add items, change the amount in stock and delete items. Additionally, the user can turn on permissions for the app to send a reminder SMS message when the stock of an item reaches 0. While good for use in inventory, this could also be used as a grocery list or any itemized list that also needs an amount attached to the item.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

My goal was to have 3 screens, or Activities. This is so that most things can be done without going back and forth between pages. I wanted to keep all functionality of the inventory screen within that screen, and nothing is hidden. I wanted to have it set up this way so there is no confustion or submenus, and all the information the user needs is in one place. I feel like this would need to change with more features, but for a simlpe app the clean UI is something I was aiming for.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

This project was different than most of my other projects, in that we were given free reign on creating the app from the ground up. I did a lot of planning and watching tutorials before desiding on how to approach the coding. While hard, using and understanding code bases, and converting and changing them to my needs helped me get to a good end product. The one thing I did throughout and that saved me a lot of time was writing code in chunks, testing, then moving on. Making sure everything is working well before moving on helped elimnate more complex bugs.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

For testing I did white box testing, and becuase the app was simple, I did not automate this testing. In a more in-depth project, I would definately need to add automated JUnit testing and run this after all changes. In this case, I was working in small chunks, or modules, so I could do most testing as I went and only did a full test run along the way at major milestones. This kept the code clean, and I think this was the way to go for this project.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

When I ran into the inital listing of items, which was the hardest part to code, the class wanted us to use gridview for our layout. After looking and reading I decided gridview was not the way I wanted to have the items displayed and listview seemed like a better option. I went with listview, which did complicate things a bit. I wanted buttons on each line, and it took awhile to figure out how to have multiple buttons align to and interact with fields only on thier line. Even though this was a much harder aproach, I think in the end the app is much more usable, and really works the way I want it to.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I am most proud of the Inventory page, or Activity. I made sure that the page updated without animations when changes were made and that it was responsive and the button layout made sense. I do feel that if I handed anyone my app, the could fully use it with out any knowledge. Following design element layouts that are familiar with an easy to understand layout is something I think I did well. 

# CS-370 Current/Emerging Trends in CS

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this course, I develped an AI Model to solve a maze using the tensorflow library and tools. The class provided base code for functinality, the environment, and rules to the game. I developed the steps taken by the agent each epoch, and how much exploration vs. explotation was done by the agent each epoch. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer Scientists use programming to solve problems, and in the class we learned how developing AI agents to solve problems can both solve and create problems. This class introduced us to the ethical implications of using AI models to make decisions, and where to look to make sure our programings are solving more problems than they create.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I feel that the first step of solving a problem as a computer scientist is do determine the best tool for this job. In this case there are a plethora of different choises in AI models alone, let alone the choises of solving a problem by use of other algorithms than AI. Finding the best fit for a program I believe is the most important step. After this, developing the code and refining your project are important, but if you start with the wrong tool, this could make the entire project harder than it needs to be.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

This course, as with many others, enforces the fact that my ethical choices and responsibilites do not just stop at my intentions, but what the program could do if in the hands of a less reputable company or end user. The full scope of a programs capabilite both for the intended problem, and for any other application it could be used for must be considered when developing. Above all sufficient testing must occcur after the project is completed, and this step should not be taken lightly.
